# Claude Code routing capture

This experiment records routed-expert IDs from natural Claude Code turns on
GLM-5.2 AutoRound W4G64 MTP3. It does not store prompts, responses, tool
arguments, or repository contents. Each trace starts at generation, avoiding
repeated counting of the conversation prefix.

The capture host uses c1/TP4/EP4 and the V1 model runner because routed-expert
return is not supported with DCP4 or Model Runner V2. Claude chooses the
natural stopping point; no 256-token output cap is applied. MTP verification
routes include rejected drafts.

Start a four-hour capture host and use it normally:

```bash
./claude-local-capture.sh
```

After collecting several representative sessions:

```bash
./claude-local-capture.sh --grid
```

The grid, ranking, heatmap, and summary are written under the capture state
directory for the active job.

Implementation source: vLLM fork commits `af5587af3` and `ffae5a399`. Two
focused route-writer tests and all commit hooks passed. The grid builder
completed a synthetic end-to-end check with the expected
`4 * 75 * 8 = 2,400` routes.

Job `1047751` exposed the Model Runner V2 incompatibility before loading
weights. V1 retry `1047770` became ready on `jpbo-008-32` and passed a streamed
Messages-API smoke test. Its trace contained 336 routed positions with shape
`336 * 78 * 8`; aggregation produced the expected
`336 * 75 * 8 = 201,600` selections. The smoke trace was moved to
`routes-1047770-smoke`, leaving `routes-1047770` empty for real Claude Code
activity.

The smoke test also caught a streamed output-token metadata bug. Commit
`ffae5a399` fixes future launches with a cumulative counter. The active
`1047770` process predates that fix, so the grid builder ignores its
`output_tokens` field; routed-expert arrays and hotness counts are unaffected.
